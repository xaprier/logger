### üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions for Linux/UNIX

Clone the repository to your directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xaprier/logger.git
```

Enter the direcotry of the source code

```sh
cd logger/
```

Build the makefile with CMake, if you don't have cmake you have to install it.

```sh
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B "build"
```

Than our Makefile is ready for build the source code. We have to access the directory of makefile and run make.

```sh
cd build && make -j$(nproc)
```

Than our compiled library is ready for run in the directory of the makefile with the name "Logger_simple_app"
You can run the sample program with this command

```sh
./Logger_TEST
```
